The purpose of this project is to create a GUI based flashcard app using Java Swing. 
This will be used to help people learn new key terms and can be used to revise certain topics. 


HOW IT WORKS:

MAKING THE FLASHCARDS
First create the Q&A by going on to the FlashCardBuilder and then typing the questions and answers on the 2 corresponding textAreas.
Each time you finish writing the question and answer - click on next card.  
By clicking on the next card - it will add the current FlashCard to a list and will allow you to work on the next one. 
Once you have finished making the flashcards you can click on file and then click on save and then enter your file name. 

LEARNING FROM THE FLASHCARDS
Here, I have added a file containing questions regarding Artificial Intelligence. When I run the FlashCardPlayer file - it will give me the option to load a card set.
Here, I will select the AI Quiz file and automatically the flashcards will be made. 


Tools:
