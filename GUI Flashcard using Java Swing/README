The purpose of this project is to create a GUI based flashcard app using Java Swing. 
This will be used to help people learn new key terms and can be used to revise certain topics. 


HOW IT WORKS:

MAKING NEW FLASHCARDS
First create the Q&A by going on to the FlashCardBuilder and then typing the questions and answers on the 2 corresponding textAreas.
Each time you finish writing the question and answer - click on next card.  
By clicking on the next card - it will add the current FlashCard to a list and will allow you to work on the next one. 
Once you have finished making the flashcards you can click on file and then click on save and then enter your file name.


ADDING NEW FLASHCARDS TO EXISTING FLASHCARD SETS
To do this - run the FlashCardBuilder file.
Click File and then click Load.
When you click load - the program iterates through the file and creates a new flashcard for each Q&A and adds it to the arraylist. 
You can add additional flashcards to increase your flashcard set size. 
You will have to save your new flash card arraylist - you can have the same file name as your previously existing one - it will just overwrite it.


LEARNING FROM THE FLASHCARDS
Here, I have added a file containing questions regarding Artificial Intelligence. When I run the FlashCardPlayer file - it will give me the option to load a card set
after I click on the file button.

Here, I will select the AI Quiz file and automatically the flashcards will be made. 
You have the option to write your own answer and then compare your answer with the actual answer by clicking on the Check Answer button. 
After you check your answer - depending on whether you got the question right or wrong - the score will be added to the tally. 
Once you finish the quiz - if your score exceeds the highest previous score - then the high score label will get updated and your score will be written to the file
You also have the opportunity to redo the questions that you got wrong.
